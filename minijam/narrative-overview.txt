Here is the narrative overiew

This game jam comes with a limitation of 'Health is a tool' 
The description provided for this limitation is

This limitation is very much open to interpretation. 
Consider health as a resource that can be used in more that just the one standard way.
This doesn't just have to be Hit Points, you can get creative with it, anything that can pass as health will work. 
Physical and mental health are both valid starting points. On top of this, the word 'tool' has a few different definitions itself, 
more than just a device used to perform or facilitate manual or mechanical work. 
Also note that this is not specifically the health of the player character, but health in general!

The decided narative theme will be around mental health, and the struggle to overcome the struggles that come with it.

The premise of the game will be the player starts their journey in a cave, a dark cave, and will be fighting through the stuggle
to exit the cave and return to the light. 

The player will also face an additional challenge; their health will be constantly decreasing throughout their journey.
The rate at which they lose their health will depend on the journey itself.

The darker the cave, the quicker they will lose health  the lighter the cave, the less health they lose. 
This enables a sense of pressure, to help the player connect and feel the struggle of their avatar.

The win condition will be making it to the end of the cave and escaping into the light.
